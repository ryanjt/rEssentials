# rEssentials
A minecraft essentials plugin for Spigot. Made for a vanilla / give a small helping hand experience when playing minecraft. My aim was to create a few commands and events to play around with Spigot. Made in IntelliJ with Maven and PaperMC API. 

# Features (so far!)
- /feed - feed's player to max food on command.
- /heal - heals player to max health on command.
- /helpme - creates a teleport stick which teleports user to home (hard-coded location at the moment for personal server). 

# Plans / Todo
- Implement a config file to save location dynamically for help me wand. 
- Implement more useful commands - basic tools, aid commands.
